## Database Tables

### `profiles`
Stores user information linked to Supabase Auth users.

**Columns:**
- `id` (uuid) - Links to auth.users
- `email` (text)
- `role` (student | faculty)
- `full_name` (text)
- `department` (text, optional)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

### `lor_requests`
Stores LOR request information.

**Columns:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `student_id`, `faculty_id` (references profiles)
- `program`, `university`, `purpose` (text)
- `deadline` (date)
- `details` (text)
- `status` (pending | in_review | approved | declined)
- `ai_draft`, `final_lor` (text, optional)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

### `notifications`
Stores notification history.

**Columns:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `user_id` (references profiles)
- `request_id` (references lor_requests)
- `message` (text)
- `is_read` (boolean)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

## Security (Row Level Security)

All tables have RLS enabled:

- **profiles**: Users can read their own profile + all faculty profiles
- **lor_requests**: Students see their requests, faculty see assigned requests
- **notifications**: Users only see their own notifications

## Troubleshooting

### "Profile creation error" in console
This is usually fine - it means the profile was already created. The app will continue to work.

### Can't see other users
- Students can only see faculty members (to select for requests)
- Faculty members can see their assigned requests
- This is by design for security

### Notifications not appearing
- Notifications are created automatically via database triggers
- Check the bell icon in the header
- Refresh the page if needed
- Auto-refresh happens every 10 seconds
